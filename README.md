## Challenge

We want to build a Multiple choice Questionnaire. After submission, we calculate a score based on the answers.

Create a questionnaire that takes two types of questions

- Questions with a single answer (radio)
- Questions with multiple answers (checkboxes)

After submitting the questionnaire, each of the users answers must be compared with the actual answer for grading.

A multiple answer question is correct if **all of the selected answers** are correct.
